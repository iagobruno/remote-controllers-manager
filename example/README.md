# Demo

It's a simple demo app but you can check out the package idea.

```bash
yarn install
```

Open a terminal and run the command:

```bash
yarn run dev:server
```

Open another terminal and run the command:

```bash
yarn run dev:client
```

Open a browser tab with url `http://localhost:1234/screen.html`, open another tab with url `http://localhost:1234/controller.html` and open another tab in incognito mode with `http://localhost:1234/controller.html`. Open the console on each tab and start playing.
